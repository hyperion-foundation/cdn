## Introduction
Hyperion Private SMP is a private Minecraft Survival Multiplayer (SMP) in Hyperion Foundation. What we mean "private", we mean only selected member is able to join our private Minecraft SMP.
We do not choose members randomly. Our SMP server is hosted on **Minecraft: Java Edition**, not the **Bedrock Edition**.

Our SMP runs in a "season". Season is a designation/call made by the developers of Hyperion Private SMP when **Mojang Studios** ("Mojang") has released the latest version for Minecraft: Java Edition.

Example:
Mojang has released the new version of Minecraft, version 1.20. So, we called it "Season 1.20".

Not every season in Hyperion Private SMP has world backup. It because when we tried to backup the world, sometimes the world file size seems a bit too large than we expected.
So, we decide if the world file size is too large, we will not going to backup it, but we will try our best to backup from every season we had.
